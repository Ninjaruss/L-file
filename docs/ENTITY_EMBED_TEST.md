# Test Entity Embeds

This document tests the entity embed functionality.

## Character Test
Here's our main character: {{character:1|Baku Madarame}}

## Arc Test  
This happens in the {{arc:1|Introduction Arc}}

## Gamble Test
The famous {{gamble:1|Simple Gamble}} example

## Multiple Embeds
In this sentence we reference {{character:1|Baku}}, the {{arc:1}} arc, and a {{gamble:1}}.

## Regular Text
This is just regular text without any embeds to make sure normal content still works properly.

## Mixed Content
- {{character:1}} is the protagonist
- {{arc:1|Introduction}} sets up the story
- {{gamble:1|First Gamble}} introduces the concept

That's the end of our test!
